# üê∂ Pupcloud

Point pupcloud to a local folder and instantly get its contents exposed as a web application. Browse, manage, share files... in a truly portable way!

Pupcloud doesn't need a database, nor it leaves .dotfiles on the filesystem; it is packaged as a single executable file (written in Go+Svelte+Typescript), so you'll just need to download and run it.

It is an exercise in minimalism: it aims to be as simple as possible, while retaining all the features you would like it to have. Just run it! It has everything that fits in a pup-sized cloud ;-)

If you are curious, go see the [Demo](https://pupcloud.vercel.app)!
