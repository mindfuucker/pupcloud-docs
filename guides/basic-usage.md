### Preview screen

1 And 2 go through the files, displaying their preview if they are [supported](basic-usage.md#supported-file-types-for-viewing). You can also use the arrow keys on the keyboard; on mobile, you can swipe with your finger.

3 Allows to download a file.

4 Closes the screen and goes back to the file manager.

5 Clicking on an image will enlarge it, cycling through full screen (still possible to use arrow keys/swipe) and full size.

### Supported file types for viewing

In the file system view, you can click on a file to open it. Currently pupcloud supports:

* Images, Audio, Video (when supported by the browser)
* PDF documents (for desktop browsers)
* Text-like files (txt, html, sources...)

Detection of file types is done by mime type, and viewing relies on the browser's capabilities.
